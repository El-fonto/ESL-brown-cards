#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description

This is a CLI implementation of a speaking activity for ESL lessons called *Talking Cards*, [originally ideated by Michael J. Brown](http://iteslj.org/Lessons/Brown-TalkingCards.html).

#### Game Flow

The original game requires:

- A deck of cards.
- a question sheet with four categories.

The objective of the game is to get the student used to answer general questions, and to give the students conversational confidence. It is perfect for a no-prep speaking class.

Each player draws a card and answer the corresponding question in four categories. The original categories where:

- ♠ **Spades**(Describing things) ♠
- ♥ **Hearts**(What questions) ♥
- ♣ **Clubs**(Mixed questions) ♣
- ♦ **Diamonds**(Conditional questions) ♦

#### About this implementation

My adaptation ignores the point system stated in the original rules because it requires participants to perform and to evaluate while having a conversation, and therefore they end up having worse conversations.

The CLI implementation smooths the use of the activity in online lessons, where having a virtual deck of cards and the question sheet open requires several windows open, or switching between windows.

The project contains a several lists of questions.

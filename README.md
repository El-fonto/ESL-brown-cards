# CLI Talking Cards for Language Lessons

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description

This is a CLI implementation of a speaking activity for ESL lessons called *Talking Cards*, [originally ideated by Michael J. Brown](http://iteslj.org/Lessons/Brown-TalkingCards.html). This implementation helps my day-to-day work as a Language Tutor, both for English Language Learners and Spanish Language Learners.

The program is especially helpful in online lessons, where having a virtual deck of cards and the question sheet open requires several tabs/windows open, or switching between tabs/windows.

#### Game Flow

The original game requires:

- A deck of cards.
- A question sheet with four categories.

The objective of the game is to get the student used to answer general questions, and to give the students conversational confidence. It is perfect for a no-prep speaking class.

A player draws a card and answer the corresponding question in four categories. The original categories are:

- ♠ **Spades** ♠ (Describing things)
- ♥ **Hearts** ♥ (What questions)
- ♣ **Clubs** ♣ (Mixed questions)
- ♦ **Diamonds** ♦ (Conditional questions)

After both players feel satisfied with their respective answers, the one running the program can move to the next question.

#### About this implementation

My adaptation ignores the point system stated in the original rules because it required participants to perform and to evaluate while having a conversation, and therefore having worse conversations.
The project contains a 3 question lists in English and 3 question lists in Spanish for levels ranging from A2-B1 of the CEFR.

```
Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! A README.md in the neighborhood of 500 words is likely to be sufficient for describing your project and all aspects of its functionality. If unable to reach that threshold, that probably means your project is insufficiently complex.
